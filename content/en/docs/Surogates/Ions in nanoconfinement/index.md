Ions in nanoconfinement(IU): This application [^5] [^19] [^49] studies
ionic structure in electrolyte solutions in nanochannels with planar
uncharged surfaces and can use multiple molecular dynamics (MD) codes
including LAMMPS [^50] which run on HPC supercomputers with OpenMP and
MPI parallelization. 

A dense neural-net (NN) was used to learn 150 final state
characteristics based on the input of 5 parameters with typical
results shown in fig. 2(b) with the NN results for three important
densities tracking well the MD simulation results for a wide range of
unseen input system parameters. Fig. 3(a,b) shows two typical density
profiles with again the NN prediction tracking well the
simulation. Input quantities were confinement length, positive ion
valency, negative ion valency, salt concentration, and ion
diameter. Figure 2(a) shows the runtime architecture for dynamic use
and update of the NN and our middleware discussed in Sec. 3.2.6 will
generalize this. The inference time for this on a single core is 104
times faster than the parallel code which is itself 100 times the
sequential code. This surrogate approach is the first-of-its-kind in
the area of simulating charged soft-matter systems and there are many
other published papers in both biomolecular and material science
presenting similar successful surrogates [^2] with a NN architecture
similar to fig. 3(c).
